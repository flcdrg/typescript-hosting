# TypeScript Hosting Test Application

This is a simple Windows Forms test application that hosts one TypeScript file and allows the running of ad-hoc JavaScript to try out the various TypeScript APIs. The application is used before adding new features to the TypeScript Addin for SharpDevelop.

## Dependencies

1. [TypeScript](http://typescript.codeplex.com/) - The TypeScript language services are used to provide code completion.
2. [Javascript.NET](http://javascriptdotnet.codeplex.com/) - A library that hosts Google's V8 JavaScript engine and allows .NET objects to be used directly from JavaScript. Currently only works on Windows.
3. [Json.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/) - Json library for .NET created by [James Newton-King](http://james.newtonking.com/).
